Hello Dears
My name is Ali Soveizi 
This line of code is related to one of my fifth semester projects in 2020
Which is related to an practixe called backpack 0_1  practice
By searching the name of this practice in Google, you can see its additional information
Now I want to do this practice in two ways: dynamic programming and backward programming in a source code in C ++.
